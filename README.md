# KeyMoody

A simple web-based project that detects a user's mood based on typing speed and keystroke dynamics.

## Features
- Tracks typing speed (WPM)
- Measures inter-key delay, burstiness, and dwell time
- Counts backspaces and long pauses
- Infers mood using simple heuristic rules (e.g., Focused, Calm, Stressed, Hurried, Distracted)
- Runs entirely in the browser (no backend required)

## How to Run
1. Download or clone this repository.
2. Open `index.html` in your browser (Chrome, Safari, or Edge).
3. Start typing in the text box to see your typing stats and mood.

## Tech Stack
- **HTML**  
- **CSS**  
- **JavaScript**

## Future Improvements
- Add sentiment analysis from text content  
- Train a machine learning model on typing data  
- Create a dashboard with charts and history
